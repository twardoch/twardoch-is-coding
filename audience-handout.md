# ü§ñ Coding with LLMs: Essential Takeaways & Quick Reference

**Speaker:** Adam Twardoch | **Email:** adam@twardoch.com  
**Research Basis:** 177 repositories, 54 Cursor projects, 1000+ Claude Code sessions

---

## üß† **LLM Fundamentals - What You Need to Know**

**Core Process:** Text ‚Üí Tokenization ‚Üí Embeddings ‚Üí Transformer ‚Üí Text  
**Key Insight:** LLMs are sophisticated pattern matching systems, not magic  
**Practical:** Understanding this helps you write better prompts and manage expectations

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Tool Selection Guide - When to Use What**

### **IDE-Based Tools (Cursor, VSCode + Copilot)**
**‚úÖ Use for:**
- Rapid prototyping and experimentation
- Learning new APIs and frameworks  
- Quick code completion and suggestions
- Interactive debugging and testing
- UI/UX development and styling

**‚ö° Best Features:**
- Real-time inline suggestions
- Low learning curve
- Immediate feedback
- Familiar development environment

### **CLI-Based Tools (Claude Code, Gemini CLI)**  
**‚úÖ Use for:**
- Complex multi-file refactoring
- Comprehensive feature implementation
- Project-wide analysis and optimization
- Automated testing and CI/CD setup
- Architecture decisions and planning

**‚ö° Best Features:**
- Project-wide understanding
- Multi-step autonomous execution
- Comprehensive planning and implementation
- Integration with external tools via MCP

---

## üîå **MCP (Model Context Protocol) - The Game Changer**

**What it enables:** AI agents that can actually DO things, not just suggest things

**Capabilities:**
- **File Operations:** Read, write, organize your entire codebase
- **Git Integration:** Analyze history, create commits, manage workflows
- **Database Access:** Query, analyze, and optimize schemas
- **Custom Tools:** Domain-specific operations tailored to your needs

**Example:** `claude "analyze codebase and suggest improvements"` ‚Üí AI reads all files, runs analysis tools, executes tests, generates comprehensive report

---

## üìä **Strategic Tool Combination - Maximum Effectiveness**

### **The Hybrid Workflow**
```
1. RESEARCH ‚Üí Gemini CLI (technology exploration)
2. PROTOTYPE ‚Üí Cursor (rapid development)  
3. IMPLEMENT ‚Üí Claude Code (comprehensive solutions)
4. REFINE ‚Üí Cursor (polish and testing)
5. DEPLOY ‚Üí CLI tools (automation)
```

### **Project Phase Strategy**
- **Exploration:** Cursor for quick iteration and learning
- **Implementation:** Claude Code for systematic, comprehensive development
- **Maintenance:** Mixed approach based on task complexity

---

## üí° **Key Success Principles**

### **‚úÖ DO:**
- **Combine tools strategically** - each has optimal use cases
- **Always review and test** AI-generated code - treat it like junior developer work
- **Use version control religiously** - your safety net for bold AI suggestions
- **Start simple, scale gradually** - MVP first, complexity later
- **Maintain security awareness** - AI can introduce vulnerabilities

### **‚ùå DON'T:**
- **Rely on single tool** - different tools for different tasks
- **Skip code review** - AI makes consistent but not infallible suggestions  
- **Ignore context limits** - break large projects into manageable chunks
- **Trust blindly** - understand what the AI is doing and why

## üõ†Ô∏è **Getting Started Recommendations**

### **For IDE Users (VSCode/IntelliJ)**
1. **Start with Cursor** - familiar environment with AI superpowers
2. **Configure .cursorrules** - project-specific AI guidance
3. **Gradually add Claude Code** - for complex, multi-file tasks

### **For CLI Enthusiasts**  
1. **Begin with Claude Code** - comprehensive project management
2. **Explore MCP servers** - extend capabilities with custom tools
3. **Add Cursor** - for rapid prototyping and visual feedback

### **For Teams**
1. **Establish AI coding standards** - consistent .cursorrules and workflows
2. **Train together** - shared learning curve and best practices
3. **Start with pilot projects** - prove value before full adoption
