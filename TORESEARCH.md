# Research Queries for "Coding with LLMs" Conference Talk

## LLM Fundamentals & Architecture

How do Large Language Models work at a fundamental level from text input to text output?

What is the process of tokenization in LLMs and how does text get converted to tokens?

How do embeddings work in LLMs and what role do they play in understanding text context?

What is the transformer architecture and how does it process embeddings to generate responses?

How does the attention mechanism work in transformers and why is it important for text generation?

What are the key differences between different LLM architectures (GPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)?

## Development Tools & Environments

What are the fundamental differences between IDE-based AI coding assistants (like GitHub Copilot in VSCode/Cursor) and CLI-based AI tools?

How does Cursor differ from standard VSCode and what unique features does it offer for AI-assisted development?
