#### Phase 1: Research and Planning (Claude Code)
```bash
# Initial project analysis and planning
claude-code "I want to add a new feature to automatically generate API documentation from Python docstrings. Analyze the existing project structure, identify integration points, and create a detailed implementation plan."
```

**Key Demonstration Points:**
- Shows project-wide understanding
- Identifies existing patterns and conventions
- Creates comprehensive implementation strategy
- Highlights potential integration challenges

#### Phase 2: Rapid Prototyping (Cursor IDE)
**Switch to Cursor with configured .cursorrules:**
```markdown
# .cursorrules for API Documentation Project
You specialize in Python API documentation tools.
Use Sphinx, FastAPI, or similar frameworks.
Focus on clean, maintainable code with comprehensive docstrings.
```

**Live Development:**
- Create `api_doc_generator.py` from scratch
- Show real-time AI assistance with Tab completions
- Demonstrate context-aware suggestions
- Build basic functionality quickly

#### Phase 3: Integration and Quality (Claude Code)
```bash
# Comprehensive integration and testing
claude-code "Review the API documentation generator I just created. Integrate it with the existing project structure, add comprehensive error handling, create unit tests, and update the project documentation."
```

**Demonstrated Capabilities:**
- Multi-file coordination
- Test generation and integration
- Documentation updates
- Error handling implementation
- Code quality improvements

#### Phase 4: Deployment Preparation (Claude Code)
```bash
# Final deployment preparation

- Test different version combinations
- Update code to handle breaking changes

#### AI-Assisted Approach (10-15 minutes)
```bash
claude-code "Several dependencies need updates, but I'm concerned about breaking changes. Analyze all dependencies, identify potential conflicts, create a safe update strategy, and implement necessary code changes."
```

4. **Context Building**: Slowly understanding project patterns

#### AI-Assisted Onboarding (2-3 hours)
```bash
# Project understanding
claude-code "I'm new to this project. Provide a comprehensive overview of the architecture, main components, coding conventions, and development workflow. Identify the most important files and explain how they interact."

# Environment setup
claude-code "Set up my development environment for this project. Install all dependencies, configure development tools, run initial tests, and verify everything is working correctly."

# First contribution
claude-code "I want to contribute to this project. Analyze the current issues and tasks, suggest a good first contribution based on my Python experience, and provide a detailed implementation guide."
```
