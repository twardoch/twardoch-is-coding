## Usage Guidelines

### Setting Up .cursorrules
1. Create `.cursorrules` file in project root
2. Choose appropriate template based on project type
3. Customize technical stack and standards for your specific needs
4. Test with small code generation tasks to validate effectiveness

### Best Practices
- **Be Specific**: Include exact libraries and versions you use
- **Set Context**: Explain the project's purpose and constraints
- **Define Standards**: Specify coding conventions and patterns
- **Include Examples**: Show preferred code structures and patterns
- **Update Regularly**: Revise as project evolves and requirements change

### Testing Your Configuration
- Ask Cursor to generate a simple function in your domain
- Verify it follows your specified patterns and libraries
- Refine the .cursorrules based on results
- Share effective configurations with team members

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Too generic (won't provide meaningful guidance)
- Too restrictive (limits creative solutions)
- Outdated information (includes deprecated libraries)
- Missing context (doesn't explain project purpose)
- No examples (hard for AI to understand preferences)
