# Solution: Git Index Corruption Issue

## Problem Description
The build script was failing with gitnextver due to git index corruption, showing:
```
assert version in (1, 2)
       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```

This occurred when gitnextver tried to read the git index file during version management operations.

## Root Cause
Git index file corruption where the index version number was invalid (not version 1 or 2 as expected by the git library).

## Solution Implemented
Created `fix-git-index.sh` script that:

1. **Diagnoses the issue**: Checks git index file existence and accessibility
2. **Creates backup**: Saves current git state (staged/unstaged changes)
3. **Fixes corruption**: Removes corrupted index file and recreates it with `git reset --mixed HEAD`
4. **Restores state**: Attempts to restore previously staged changes
5. **Verifies fix**: Tests git operations and gitnextver functionality

## Fix Script Features
- ✅ Comprehensive backup of git state before making changes
- ✅ Color-coded progress reporting
- ✅ Automatic detection of git repository
- ✅ File change preservation (all 6 changes preserved successfully)
- ✅ Verification testing of git operations
- ✅ Error handling and rollback capabilities

## Result
- ✅ Git index corruption resolved
- ✅ All file changes preserved
- ✅ Build script working normally
- ✅ Git operations functioning correctly
- ✅ Backup created at `/tmp/git_backup_20250823_001449`

## Prevention
The enhanced build script now includes git repository validation that can detect such issues early and provide guidance.

## Files Modified
- `fix-git-index.sh` - Automated fix script
- `build.sh` - Enhanced with git validation
- `TODO.md` - Task marked as completed

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED
