# Speaker Notes: "Coding with LLMs: Tools and Techniques for Modern Development"
**Duration:** 20 minutes + Q&A  
**Audience:** TeX and Context developers (experienced programmers, 50+ years old)

---

## üéØ **Opening - Establish Credibility** *(1 minute)*

### Key Message
*"I'm not here to theorize - I'm here to share what actually works from 177 real projects"*

### Talking Points
- **Hook**: "Over the past 18 months, I've used AI coding tools across 177 repositories"
- **Evidence**: "54 projects with Cursor, 1000+ Claude Code sessions, real production results"
- **Promise**: "Today I'll show you exactly what works, what doesn't, and when to use each tool"

### **TIMING CUE: 1 minute - Move to Section 1**

## üìä **Section 1: How LLMs Actually Work** *(5 minutes total)*

### Opening Hook *(30 seconds)*
*"Before we talk tools, let's demystify what's under the hood - no PhD required"*

### **Slide: The LLM Pipeline** *(1 minute)*
- **Key Point**: "It's just sophisticated pattern matching - Text ‚Üí Numbers ‚Üí Processing ‚Üí Text"
- **Emphasis**: "No magic, just math we don't need to understand to use effectively"

### **Slide: Tokenization** *(1 minute)*
- **Demo Concept**: "Your code becomes numbers: `function calculateSum` becomes `[1034, 717, 2341]`"
- **Key Insight**: "Different models tokenize differently - that's why some understand code better"
- **Practical**: "Cursor is optimized for code tokenization, Claude Code for project context"

### **Slide: Embeddings** *(1 minute)*
- **Analogy**: "Think of it as a 768-dimensional filing system where similar concepts cluster together"
- **Example**: "`cat` and `dog` are neighbors, but `car` lives in a different neighborhood"
- **Practical**: "This is why LLMs can suggest relevant functions and patterns"

### **Slide: Transformer Architecture** *(1 minute)*
- **Key Innovation**: "Parallel processing - it sees all your code at once, not line by line"
- **Advantage**: "That's why it can refactor across multiple files consistently"
- **Contrast**: "Unlike search-and-replace, it understands relationships"

### **Slide: Attention Mechanism** *(30 seconds)*
- **Simple Explanation**: "Each word asks 'who should I pay attention to?'"
- **Code Example**: "In `her laptop`, 'her' pays attention to 'programmer' from earlier context"
- **Power**: "This is why it can maintain context across thousands of lines"

### **TIMING CUE: 6 minutes total - Move to Section 2**

## ‚öîÔ∏è **Section 2: IDE vs CLI - Two Paradigms** *(6 minutes total)*

### Transition *(15 seconds)*
*"Now that you understand the engine, let's talk about the vehicles"*

### **Slide: IDE-Based Tools** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Strengths**: "Real-time, immediate, low learning curve"
- **Best for**: "Rapid prototyping, learning new APIs, quick fixes"
- **Example**: "GitHub Copilot excels at `// create user model` ‚Üí instant implementation"
- **Limitation**: "File-focused, limited project understanding"

### **Slide: Cursor Advantages** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Key Differentiator**: "AI-first editor, not just AI-enhanced VSCode"
- **Demo Setup**: "Show .cursorrules file example"
- **Read Example**: "TypeScript + React functional components + JSDoc comments"
- **Power**: "Project-wide context, not just current file"

### **Slide: CLI-Based Tools** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Strengths**: "Project-wide understanding, multi-step execution, automation"
- **Best for**: "Complex refactoring, comprehensive implementations, system-wide changes"
- **Example**: "Claude Code: single command implements auth system with tests and docs"
- **Key Insight**: "Planning then executing vs. suggesting then you executing"

### **Slide: Comparison Table** *(1 minute)*
- **Speed**: "IDE for immediate feedback, CLI for comprehensive solutions"
- **Scope**: "IDE for file-level, CLI for project-level"
- **Automation**: "IDE for assistance, CLI for autonomous execution"

### **Strategic Insight** *(30 seconds)*
*"The secret isn't choosing one - it's knowing when to use each"*

### **TIMING CUE: 12 minutes total - Move to Section 3**

## üîå **Section 3: The MCP Revolution** *(6 minutes total)*

### Transition *(15 seconds)*
*"This is where AI stops being a text generator and becomes a true development partner"*

### **Slide: MCP Architecture** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Problem**: "Traditional AI: prompt ‚Üí response. Limited to training data."
- **Solution**: "MCP: prompt ‚Üí planning ‚Üí tool usage ‚Üí execution ‚Üí result"
- **Key Point**: "AI can now read files, run tests, commit code, deploy applications"

### **Slide: Simple vs Agentic APIs** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Old Way**: "You ask, it answers, you implement"
- **New Way**: "You ask, it plans, discovers tools, executes, reports back"
- **Analogy**: "From asking directions to having a copilot who can actually drive"

### **Slide: MCP Server Examples** *(1 minute)*
- **File System**: "Read, write, organize files"
- **Git Operations**: "Analyze history, create commits, manage branches"
- **Database**: "Query, analyze, optimize schemas"
- **Custom Tools**: "Your domain-specific operations"

### **Slide: MCP in Action** *(1.5 minutes)*
- **Real Example**: "claude 'analyze codebase and suggest improvements'"
- **Behind the scenes**: "Reads all files ‚Üí runs static analysis ‚Üí executes tests ‚Üí generates report"
- **From pdf22png project**: "42 commits, complete CI/CD pipeline, comprehensive testing"
- **Key Insight**: "Hours of work in minutes, but with professional quality"

### **Future Vision** *(30 seconds)*
*"This isn't just about coding faster - it's about coding at a higher level of abstraction"*

1. **"LLMs are pattern matchers, not magic"** - Understanding helps you use them better
2. **"IDE and CLI tools complement each other"** - Strategic combination is key
3. **"MCP enables true automation"** - Beyond completion to autonomous execution
4. **"Strategic tool combination maximizes effectiveness"** - Right tool for right task
5. **"Human oversight remains essential"** - AI amplifies judgment, doesn't replace it

### **TIMING CUE: 21.5 minutes total - Q&A**

---

## üé§ **Q&A Preparation**

### **Anticipated Questions & Responses**

**Q: "What about job security for developers?"**
**A:** "These tools make us more productive, not obsolete. I'm shipping 10x more features, handling more complex projects. The demand for experienced developers who can orchestrate AI tools is actually increasing."

**Q: "How do you ensure code quality with AI assistance?"**
**A:** "Same way you ensure quality with junior developers - comprehensive testing, code reviews, and established standards. The .cursorrules file and systematic prompting become your quality gates."

**Q: "What about learning curve for older developers?"**
**A:** "Start with Cursor for familiar IDE experience, then gradually add Claude Code for complex tasks. The key is strategic adoption, not wholesale replacement of your workflow."

**Q: "Which tool should I start with?"**
**A:** "Cursor if you're coming from VSCode and want immediate benefits. Claude Code if you prefer command-line tools and want project-wide capabilities. Both if you want maximum effectiveness."

**Q: "How do you handle AI-generated bugs?"**
**A:** "Same way you handle human-generated bugs - good testing practices, version control, and systematic debugging. AI bugs are often more consistent and predictable than human bugs."

**Q: "What about costs?"**
**A:** "Cursor is $20/month, Claude Code usage-based. But consider the productivity gain - if these tools save you 10 hours a month, they pay for themselves many times over."
