# Project Rationale & Task Analysis: "Coding with LLMs" Conference

## 🎯 **Project Rationale**

This repository represents a comprehensive educational initiative to bridge the knowledge gap between experienced developers and modern AI-assisted coding workflows. The project emerged from Adam Twardoch's extensive real-world experience with LLM tools across 177+ repositories, encompassing both practical implementation and pedagogical presentation.

### **Core Problem Statement**
Experienced developers, particularly in specialized communities like TeX/Context (50+ year-old seasoned programmers), need practical guidance on integrating Large Language Models into their development workflows without requiring deep machine learning expertise. The current landscape is fragmented between overly technical ML resources and oversimplified marketing materials.

### **Unique Value Proposition**
- **Research-Backed Insights**: Built on analysis of 177 repositories, 54 Cursor projects, and 1000+ Claude Code sessions
- **Practical Focus**: Real-world examples from production projects (pdf22png, claif-packages, vttiro, boabro)
- **Audience-Appropriate**: Technical depth without ML mathematical complexity
- **Tool-Agnostic Wisdom**: Comprehensive comparison across IDE and CLI paradigms

## 📋 **Overall Task Description**

### **Primary Deliverables**

#### 1. **Conference Presentation** (20 minutes)
- **Format**: Live presentation using Marpit-generated slides
- **Audience**: Experienced developers at TeX/Context community conference
- **Structure**: Four precisely timed sections (5+6+6+3 minutes)
- **Content**: LLM fundamentals → Tool paradigms → MCP revolution → Personal journey

#### 2. **Comprehensive Documentation Site**
- **Format**: MkDocs-generated static site with Material theme
- **Purpose**: Extended reference accompanying the talk
- **Scope**: In-depth exploration of all topics covered in presentation
