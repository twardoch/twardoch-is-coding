# Real Project Analysis

This section analyzes real projects from Adam Twardoch's development portfolio, showcasing practical applications of LLM-assisted development across different domains and tool combinations.

## Research Foundation

The analysis is based on comprehensive examination of:

- **177 repositories** in the development portfolio
- **54 projects** with .specstory folders (Cursor usage evidence)
- **Thousands of Claude Code sessions** documented in ~/.claude/projects/
- **Recent high-activity projects** with detailed git histories

## Key Projects Overview

### High-Activity Recent Projects

| Project | Commits (60d) | Tool Focus | Domain |
|---------|---------------|------------|---------|
| [pdf22png](pdf22png.md) | 42 | CI/CD Pipeline | File Processing |
| [claif-packages](claif-packages.md) | 50+ per component | Multi-project Management | Python CLI Tools |
| [vttiro](vttiro.md) | 100+ sessions | Video Processing | Multimedia |
| [boabro](../workflows/cursor-integration.md) | Extensive .specstory | Web Development | Font Technology |

### Tool Usage Patterns

**Cursor Projects (54 total)**

**Primary Tools:** Cursor for quick exploration, Gemini CLI for research
**Examples:** Various experimental repositories

## Development Patterns

### Tool Selection Strategy

**Project Initiation**
1. **Research Phase**: Gemini CLI for technology investigation
2. **Prototyping**: Cursor for rapid development
3. **Implementation**: Claude Code for complex logic
4. **Refinement**: Return to Cursor for polish

**Maintenance Workflows**
1. **Issue Analysis**: Claude Code for comprehensive review
2. **Quick Fixes**: Cursor for immediate changes
3. **Major Updates**: Claude Code for systematic changes
4. **Documentation**: Mixed approach based on scope

### Collaboration Patterns

**Solo Development**
- Heavy reliance on AI pair programming
- Extensive use of planning modes
- Iterative refinement processes
- Comprehensive documentation generation

**Team Coordination**
- AI-generated documentation for handoffs
- Consistent coding standards via .cursorrules
- Automated quality checks
- Shared knowledge base development

## Success Metrics

## Lessons Learned

### What Works Well

**Strategic Tool Combination**
- Use Cursor for interactive development
- Use Claude Code for systematic changes
- Use Gemini CLI for research and analysis
- Combine tools within single workflows

**Planning and Iteration**
- Start with comprehensive planning (Claude Code)
- Implement incrementally (Cursor)
- Review and refactor systematically (Claude Code)
- Test and refine continuously (mixed approach)

**Documentation Integration**
- Generate documentation alongside code
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Use AI for technical writing

### Common Pitfalls

**Over-reliance on Single Tools**
- Each tool has optimal use cases
- Switching tools requires context rebuilding
- Some tasks better suited for human input
- Balance automation with manual oversight

**Context Management**
- Large projects exceed AI context windows
- Important to maintain clear project structure
- Documentation helps AI understand intent
- Regular context refresh needed

**Quality Control**
- AI-generated code requires human review
- Testing remains critical
- Security considerations need attention
- Performance implications must be evaluated

## Best Practices Extracted
