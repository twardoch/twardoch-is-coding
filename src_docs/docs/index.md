# Coding with LLMs: Tools and Techniques for Modern Development

!!! info "Conference Talk Documentation"
    This documentation accompanies Adam Twardoch's 20-minute conference presentation for TeX and Context developers, exploring the practical integration of Large Language Models in software development workflows.

## Overview

Large Language Models have revolutionized software development, but the landscape of tools and techniques can be overwhelming. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to understanding and adopting LLM-assisted development, covering everything from fundamental concepts to advanced workflows.

## What You'll Learn

### ðŸ§  LLM Fundamentals
Understand how Large Language Models work without deep mathematical background:
- **Tokenization**: How text becomes numbers
- **Embeddings**: Mapping tokens to semantic vector space
- **Transformer Architecture**: The engine behind modern LLMs
- **Attention Mechanism**: How models understand context

### âš¡ Development Paradigms
Compare and contrast different AI coding approaches:
- **IDE-based Tools**: VSCode + Copilot, Cursor advantages
- **CLI-based Tools**: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, agentic workflows
- **When to use what**: Strategic tool selection for different tasks

### ðŸ”Œ MCP Protocol
Explore the Model Context Protocol revolution:
- **Simple vs Agentic APIs**: From completion to autonomous action
- **MCP Servers**: Extensible tool ecosystems
- **Real-world Integration**: Practical examples and implementations

### ðŸ“ˆ Real Project Analysis
Learn from actual development experiences:
- **pdf22png**: 42 commits in 60 days with CI/CD implementation
- **claif-packages**: Multi-project Python ecosystem development
- **vttiro**: 100+ Claude Code sessions for video processing
- **Workflow Evolution**: How tools and techniques evolved over time

## Research Foundation

This documentation is based on extensive analysis of:

- **177 repositories** in Adam's development portfolio
- **54 projects** with .specstory folders (Cursor usage evidence)
- **Thousands of Claude Code session records** from ~/.claude/projects/
- **Recent high-activity projects** with detailed git histories
- **Comprehensive research** using multiple AI tools and sources

## Target Audience

This content is designed for **experienced programmers** (particularly TeX and Context developers) who:

- Have solid programming experience but limited ML/AI background
- Want to understand LLM fundamentals without complex mathematics
- Need practical guidance for adopting AI-assisted development
- Are interested in real-world workflows and best practices
- Value concrete examples over theoretical concepts

## Getting Started

1. **Start with [LLM Fundamentals](llm/fundamentals.md)** to understand the underlying technology
2. **Explore [Development Tools](tools/paradigms.md)** to understand your options
3. **Learn about [MCP Protocol](mcp/introduction.md)** for advanced capabilities
4. **Study [Real Projects](projects/overview.md)** for practical insights
5. **Implement [Workflows](workflows/best-practices.md)** in your own development

## Key Takeaways

!!! success "Essential Insights"
    - **LLMs are sophisticated pattern matching systems**, not magic
    - **IDE and CLI tools complement each other**, each with distinct advantages
    - **MCP enables true AI automation** beyond simple text completion
    - **Strategic tool combination** leads to more effective development
    - **Security and review practices** remain critical with AI assistance

## About the Speaker

**Adam Twardoch** is an experienced developer with a extensive portfolio of AI-assisted projects. His work demonstrates practical approaches to integrating LLMs into real-world development workflows, from simple automation to complex multi-project ecosystems.
