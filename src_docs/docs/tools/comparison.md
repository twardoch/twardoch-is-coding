## Detailed Feature Comparison

### Context Understanding

#### GitHub Copilot
- **Scope**: Current file only
- **Depth**: Syntax and immediate patterns
- **Memory**: None between sessions
- **Integration**: File-level awareness

```python
# Copilot sees only this file's context
def calculate_total(items):
    # Cannot reference other files' tax calculation logic
    tax_rate = 0.08  # Hard-coded, doesn't know about config.py
    return sum(item.price for item in items) * (1 + tax_rate)
```

#### Cursor
- **Scope**: Project-wide with selective loading
- **Depth**: File relationships and dependencies
- **Memory**: Session-based with .cursorrules
- **Integration**: Native IDE integration

```python
# Cursor understands project structure
def calculate_total(items):
    # Knows about config.py and suggests:
    from config import TAX_RATE
    # Knows about existing TaxCalculator class
    calculator = TaxCalculator()
    return calculator.calculate_with_tax(items)
```

#### Claude Code
- **Scope**: Complete project understanding
- **Depth**: Architecture and design patterns
- **Memory**: Persistent across sessions
- **Integration**: Full project coordination

```python
# Claude Code understands entire ecosystem
def calculate_total(items):
    """
    Claude Code analyzes:
    - Existing tax calculation patterns
    - Error handling conventions
    - Testing requirements
    - API consistency needs
    """
    from services.tax_service import TaxService
    from models.order import OrderCalculation
    
    tax_service = TaxService()
    calculation = OrderCalculation(items)
    return tax_service.calculate_total_with_tax(calculation)
```

#### Gemini CLI
- **Scope**: Research and analysis focus
- **Depth**: Domain knowledge and best practices
- **Memory**: Research session continuity
- **Integration**: Information synthesis

```bash
# Gemini CLI provides research context
gemini-cli "Research tax calculation strategies for e-commerce platforms, including international considerations, compliance requirements, and scalable architectures"
```

### Code Generation Capabilities

#### Speed vs Quality Trade-offs

| Tool | Generation Speed | Code Quality | Consistency | Coordination |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Copilot** | Instant | Variable | File-local | None |
| **Cursor** | Near-instant | Good | Project-aware | Limited |
| **Claude Code** | 10-30 seconds | High | Architectural | Full |
| **Gemini CLI** | N/A | N/A | N/A | Research |

#### Example: Adding Authentication

**GitHub Copilot Approach:**
```python
# File: auth.py
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    # Basic pattern completion
    user = get_user(username)
    if user and check_password(password, user.password_hash):
        return user
    return None
```

**Cursor Approach:**
```python
# File: auth.py - Context-aware generation
def authenticate_user(username, password):
    """Authenticate user with proper error handling."""
    try:
        user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()
        if user and bcrypt.check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
            # Cursor knows about existing session management
            create_user_session(user)
            return user
    except DatabaseError as e:
        logger.error(f"Authentication error: {e}")
    return None
```

**Claude Code Approach:**
```bash
claude-code "Implement user authentication with JWT tokens, including password validation, session management, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling across all relevant files"
```

Results in coordinated changes across:
- `auth.py` - Authentication logic
- `models.py` - User model updates
- `middleware.py` - JWT validation
- `config.py` - Security configuration
- `tests/` - Comprehensive test coverage
- `docs/` - API documentation
