# LLM-Assisted Development Workflows

This guide presents proven workflows for integrating LLM tools into software development, based on analysis of 177 real projects and thousands of development sessions.

## Overview of Hybrid Development

Modern LLM-assisted development isn't about replacing human developersâ€”it's about strategic amplification of human capabilities through intelligent tool combination.

### The Three-Tool Strategy

**Research Phase**: Gemini CLI for exploration and analysis  
**Development Phase**: Cursor for rapid iteration, Claude Code for complex implementation  
**Maintenance Phase**: Claude Code for systematic improvements and automation

## Project Lifecycle Workflows

### 1. Project Initiation Workflow

#### Phase 1: Research and Planning (Gemini CLI)
```bash
# Technology exploration
gemini "Compare Node.js frameworks for building REST APIs: Express, Fastify, and NestJS. Consider performance, ecosystem, learning curve, and maintenance overhead for a team of 3 developers"

# Architecture planning
gemini "Design a microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform with user management, product catalog, order processing, and payment integration"

# Risk assessment
gemini "What are the main technical risks and challenges in building a real-time collaborative document editor, and how can they be mitigated?"
```

**Outputs:**
- Technology recommendations with trade-offs
- Architectural blueprints and diagrams
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Implementation timeline estimates

#### Phase 2: Project Structure Setup (Claude Code)
```bash
# Create comprehensive project foundation
claude "Initialize a Node.js project with TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and Docker. Set up development environment, testing framework, CI/CD pipeline, and comprehensive documentation structure"

# Results in:
# - Complete project scaffolding
# - Development tooling configuration
# - Testing framework setup
# - Docker containerization
# - CI/CD pipeline implementation
# - Documentation templates
```

**Benefits:**

- API documentation
- Integration with existing code

**Step 3: Refinement and Polish (Cursor)**
```typescript
// Fine-tuning user experience
// Adjusting styling and interactions
// Performance optimizations
// Edge case handling
```

### 3. Maintenance and Evolution Workflow

#### Continuous Improvement Pattern

**Weekly Code Health Review (Claude Code)**
```bash
# Comprehensive codebase analysis
claude "Analyze the entire codebase for code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, and technical debt. Provide prioritized recommendations for improvements"

# Dependency updates and security
claude "Review all dependencies for updates, security issues, and compatibility. Create a plan for safe upgrades with comprehensive testing"

# Documentation maintenance
claude "Review and update all documentation to ensure accuracy, completeness, and usefulness. Generate missing documentation where needed"
```

**Monthly Architecture Review (Gemini CLI + Claude Code)**
```bash
# Architecture analysis with Gemini CLI
gemini "Analyze this codebase architecture for scalability issues, design pattern consistency, and alignment with modern best practices. Suggest improvements for the next 6 months"

# Implementation with Claude Code
claude "Implement the architectural improvements suggested in the analysis, ensuring backward compatibility and comprehensive testing"
```

## Tool-Specific Workflow Patterns

### Cursor Workflows

#### Rapid Prototyping Pattern
1. **Create basic structure** with live suggestions
2. **Iterate quickly** on functionality
3. **Test ideas immediately** with real-time feedback
4. **Refine user experience** through rapid cycles

// 1. Start with component structure
const UserDashboard = () => {
  // Cursor suggests state management
  // 2. Add state and effects rapidly
  // 3. Implement UI with real-time preview
  // 4. Refine styling and interactions
}
```

#### Code Review and Refinement Pattern
1. **Use Cursor chat** for code explanation
2. **Apply suggestions** with inline assistance
